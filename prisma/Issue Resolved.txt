Issue Resolved

Not being able to add or delete records with one to many relations due to a error on data?

Fixed aboved

instead of using prisma use mongoDB to force delete

Issue
logging into google account would have a callback error with error saying user not found which references the above. Corrupted data in a feild. 

Fixed above

forcing mongoDB to delete the account than could now sign in through google auth. That recreated the account and with the record relation it created a new user.
